(b) Each Party (the &quot;Receiving Party&quot;) shall treat any and all Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other Party (the &quot;Disclosing Party&quot;) pursuant to this Agreement as confidential, including information concerning the Projects or the transactions contemplated hereby disclosed before or after the Effective Date.<br />

If, in the absence of a protective order, Receiving Party is nonetheless advised by counsel that disclosure of the Confidential Information is required (after exhausting any appeal requested by the Disclosing Party at the Disclosing Party&rsquo;s expense and permitted under Applicable Law), the Receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information without liability hereunder provided that only such portion of the Confidential Information required to be disclosed shall be made available.<br />
(f) The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that the Disclosing Party will suffer irreparable harm in the event of any breach of the Receiving Party&rsquo;s obligations under this Section 13 for which money damages would not be a sufficient remedy, and the Disclosing Party will be entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief as remedies for any such breach, plus legal fees and court costs incurred in pursuing such remedies. Such remedies will not be deemed to be exclusive remedies to the Disclosing Party for a breach of this Section 13 by the Receiving Party but will be in addition to all other remedies at Law or in equity.</p></p>
