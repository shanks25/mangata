            27. COURIER AND RESTAURANT USERS</h2>

        <p>
           27.1 If you are a Courier User or a Restaurant User on our network, this section applies to you. Except to
            the extent that you also use Platform and related activities as a customer, only the provisions of
            these
            Terms that govern the use of the Platform software and the digital interface with our network apply to
            you,
            and your Existing Agreement (as defined below) with us remains the primary agreement between you and
            us. To the extent the terms of your Existing Agreement are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict
            with,
            the terms and conditions herein, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions herein apply,
            but
            solely with respect to the use of the Platform software and the digital interface with our network. If
            your
            Existing Agreement does not contain provisions that are at least as restrictive as Sections 20, 21 and
            22,
            those provisions apply to you, but they only affect our or your rights or obligations hereunder.</p>

        <h2>
            28. GENERAL</h2>

        <p>
            28.1 These Terms, together with Company&#39;s Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between the
            parties relating to the Platform and all related activities, except to the extent that you are a Courier
            User or
            a Restaurant User on our network, in which case Section 27 of these Terms governs the interaction
            between
            these Terms and your separate Courier or Restaurant agreement with us (your &quot;Existing Agreement&quot;).
            If
            any part of these Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severed</p>

      

        <p>
           28.2 and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. The failure of Company
            to
            exercise or enforce any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right
            or
            provision. Any waiver of any right or provision by us must be in writing and will only apply to the specific
            instance identified in such writing. You may not assign these Terms or any rights or licenses granted
            hereunder, whether voluntarily, by operation of law, or otherwise without our prior written consent. We
            may
            assign these Terms without restriction.</p>

            the Province of Alberta and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without giving effect to any

            location.</p>

        <p>
            29.2 Any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Platform and under these Terms will be

            irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such action or proceeding. You waive
            any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to the venue of such
            courts.</p>

            representative of the party waiving its right. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right,
            remedy,
            power or privilege arising from these Terms operates, or may be construed, as a waiver thereof. No
            single
            or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder precludes any other or further
            exercise
            thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege.</p>
